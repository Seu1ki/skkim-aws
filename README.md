## Project using AWS (amazon web service)

The project activities are divided into two parts [Data processing application + Web application].

### PART1. Data processing application   
Data processing application is based on Apache Airflow, an open-source workflow management platform for data pipelines. Information is extracted by analyzing data based on statistical data of public data.

* src 0: Traffic accidents by road type and climate condition <https://www.data.go.kr/>
* res 0: the event most likely to occur
* res 1: Increment rate of the largest increase compared to the previous year
* res 2: cumulative number of incidents by road type

The data pipeline operation of airflow is written in data-pipeline/README.md.

### PART2. Web application   
The web application server provides visualization of database query results.   
It is based on pyscript PWA Example <https://github.com/mikeckennedy/pyscript-pwa-example.git> from @mikeckennedy, using Flask, a micro-web framework written in Python that can be written in a single file.
```diff
Implement real weather visualization
- random weather
+ get today weather from Meteorological Agency website
Implement query to database and visualization information
+ [text] the event most likely to occur
+ [text] Increment rate of the largest increase compared to the previous year
+ [bar-chart] cumulative number of incidents by road type
```
